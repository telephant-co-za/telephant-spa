## Introduction
A significant portion of the population in South Africa uses a pre-paid airtime and data model (as opposed to contracts, which necessitate far more credit checks and formality, as well as a monthly salary). Pay-as-you-go is the term for this pre-paid model. The use of data with smartphones has skyrocketed in recent years.  So, for example, Whats App is a fantastic service because it allows people to connect for far less money than phone calls over mobile networks. 

Uber, Uber Eats, Taxify, Mr Delivery, and Take-a-Lot, among others, have provided a large number of opportunities for people to work as drivers.  Huge numbers of Uber Eats delivery men wait with their motorcycles outside restaurants during lunch and dinner hours to pick up and deliver orders. There are up to 30 000 of these drivers in Johannesburg alone. Data is required to access these applications, and they are spending thousands of Rand per month on data.

Many people may not have access to wifi hotspots in their houses, and wifi is not as readily available in cafes and commercial areas as it is in America and Europe. A trip to the store is needed to obtain airtime at large retail shops like Checkers, Pick n Pay or a petrol station. The users will purchase airtime in small denominations, such as R5.00 (~0.28 Euro).

Africa's Talking has an API that developers can use to build apps that can send airtime to phones. It provides this service in many African countries, including South Africa on the three major cellphone networks. As a result, I'd like to build a web app (web and mobile) that can address the following use cases:

**1) Airtime vendors** will be able to send airtime to customers through the app. So, in return for cash, the vendor will send airtime; this will save the Uber Delivery driver time because he won't have to go to a retail store to buy airtime before his shift. He will buy it from airtime vendors that meet them in the restuarant parking lots.

**2) Informal traders and spaza shops (localised retailers)** can also use the app and eventually a USSD interface to sell airtime to customers  - consumers must travel by taxi (or walk) into large commercial areas to buy small amounts of data R 5.00 (~0.28 EUR), when a taxi ride can cost up to R 20.00 (~1.12 EUR)!  With the app local, street side vendors will be able to sell airtime to the consumers.

**3) Employers** need air time for their employees to communicate with them. This can happen on two levels. 

**3.1) Domestic employees:** Domestic helpers in South Africa assist with laundry, washing, gardening, and construction/painting, among other tasks. There are mostly unofficial work relationships. Many people (for example, housewives) will use the app to give airtime to their domestic helpers as part of their pay and so they can keep a line of communication.

**3.2) Small and medium enterprises:** Employers in larger companies face a similar issue. An API can be made available so that employers can integrate their payroll, tax, and ERP systems into the service. This will allow the company to provide monthly airtime allocation to staff. Many types of business communication, such as group and support chats and important company messages, are sent via Whats App, but the company does not provide wifi or cell phone contracts to all employees; only white collar workers receive these benefits. It is clearly a discriminatory labor practice to deny airtime to all workers.

**4) Banking as a Service**
There are a large number of "unbankable" people in South Africa. This has a complex explanation. Undocumented immigrants, for example, do not have official documents or addresses. However the key explanation is that the cost of opening and maintaining a bank account is prohibitively high. Therefore people should be able to share "credit" on the app and give them some of the services of banking.

This means that credit on the app begins to function like a currency. For example, if an informal vendor sells you anything (say, a banana) for 80c and you need 20c in change, you might get your change in the form of sweets (Chappies chewing gums). Chappies chewing gum has effectively become a form of currency among informal traders.  So the system's liquidity is going to be its utility. People will still need airtime and data and will transfer it in small denominations, making it a currency replacement at that level.

Beta
Currently, the app is a working beta version of the final product. Before the application can go live, there are a few things that need to happen. The API must be linked to a USSD gateway, and thorough user testing must be completed before moving to a completely redundant, cloud-based infrastructure.
